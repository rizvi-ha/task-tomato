I found myself often times using Pomodoro timers online (shoutout to pomofocus.io) while writing out timelines on paper, which
made me realize that an online tool that combined these things would be really useful to me.

This website aims to be a much more complete scheduling/productivity tool than a simple timer.

At the top you have a timeline of events that you can populate with tasks from your To-Do list, and you get a timer
based on the current time and the scheduling of your events.

You get a notification sound whenever a break or rest period ends, and a live timer in the browser tab as well so you can minimize the site
and focus on your work!

If you want to try it for yourself check out the link above or simply clone and run

    npm i

and then

    npm run dev
